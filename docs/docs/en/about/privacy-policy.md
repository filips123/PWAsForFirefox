## Extension Privacy Policy

The extension exchanges personal data (current website and manifest URLs, as well as other
PWA details) with the native program when the user initiates the web app installation.
This is necessary in order to correctly obtain and parse the Web Application Manifest and
install the web app. Data are stored on the computer as long as that web app is installed.
No personal data leave the computer or are sent to third parties.
