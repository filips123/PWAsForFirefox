# Updates

The extension and native versions should be kept in sync to avoid potential problems and
missing features. It is recommended to keep them updated to the newest available version,
unless there are known big bugs in that release.

As the native program cannot perform automatic updates, there are two options for keeping
it up to date. The first one is to manually update the native program when the extension
updates. When extension detects an outdated native program, it will display a notification
with update instructions.

On supported platforms, you can also install the native program with the supported package
managers and manage updates through it. Please keep in mind that some package managers
might have delayed releases.
