# Native Installation

!!! tip

    The extension should automatically display the installation instructions after
    installing it and accepting the licence agreement. If it does not, you can click
    the extension widget to display them again. The extension will not work properly
    without the native component installed.

You can read the instructions for the installation from package repositories, release
binaries and source in [the native README file][link-native-readme].
